man SSH

I used man to query SSH. Man give me an explanation of the queried command its various options 
and explanations for those options. 

ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing com-
     mands on a remote machine.  It is intended to replace rlogin and rsh, and provide secure
     encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 con-
     nections and arbitrary TCP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

     ssh connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user name).  The user
     must prove his/her identity to the remote machine using one of several methods depending
     on the protocol version used (see below).
